# MksMonster8V2SermoonD1Klipper
Klipper settings for MKS Monster8 V2 build into the Creality Sermoon D1

This is WIP, do not use it yet.
I will add details here when it is ready and works.

# Progress

## Mechanics
Created an adapter to mount the Monster8 since it does not fit to the mounting holes. I also added some mounts for a big 120mm fan (because it was easier with a fan larger than the board). The fan runs with about 600 rmp and is barly audible.

Note: You either need to cut a hole onto the bottom sheet or replace it with some new and larger feet (my plan).

Note2: The original mainboard fan does not transport much air, but makes quite some noise. So a slow turning 120mm fan is much better.
The next source of noise is the fan in the power supply. I replaced that fan with a low noise 120mm fan. Now it is barly audible.

Note3: We need heigher feet. Already printed some test feet with 28mm height (need 40mm screws - probably will increase by 5mm when I have that screws available).

Note4: I cannot check whether the original wires are long enough since I did buy the printer used and the wires are not original anymore.
## Klipper

Waiting for the board, in the meantime I start with the configs based on my configs for the SKR3 board.
